            </div>
            <p>The gigantic green and yellow Link buses are needless to say, a common sight all over Kampala, Uganda’s capital. At least, we’ve all come across one as it carefully navigates its way through Uganda’s crowded streets, perhaps bringing to light that the greatest empires come from the most passionate, humble beginnings.</p><p>Mr. Solomon Nsimire, an Electrical Engineer by profession as well as the company’s Managing Director candidly recalls Link Bus Services’ rise to being one of the most prominent, reputable and reliable passenger transportation companies in Uganda today. The much admired mega brand was inspired by the Director’s deeply rooted passion for the transportation industry. Solomon’s journey in passenger transportation dates back in 1996 when as Sole Proprietor, he acquired his first 14-seater mini bus locally known as “Kamunye” which was commuting within Kampala city and the environs. He worked hard and by 2002 he had added expanded the fleet to seven vehicles five of which were 35-seater mini buses also known as “Coasters”. In 2003 Solomon sold off the mini buses and acquired his first 67-seater bus which was licensed to operate between Kampala City and Kagadi in the then Kibaale District under the trade name LINK literally derived from the service of linking/connecting people from one area to another. By 2009 the bus fleet had been expanded to eight 65-seater buses operating from Kampala to three destinations in Western Uganda.</p><p>Owing to steady growth in business operations, Mr. Solomon Nsimire and his wife, Mrs. Beatrice Nsimire founded and registered Link Bus Services Limited under the laws of Republic of Uganda</p><p>From its inception in 2010 to date, Link Bus Services Limited boasts of a fleet of over fifty 67-seater fully functional buses operating along eight routes across Uganda and employs over 200 direct and indirect workers who provide timely, reliable, affordable, efficient and safe travel to over 4000 passengers daily.</p>

You see, we look beyond present comfort and cater for oversights like mechanical problems that might arise along the way by ensuring that every working bus has a qualified mechanic on its team.

Although such incidents are extremely rare, we strongly  believe in helping people and their luggage safely reach their destination and that’s exactly what we do.

                                    Link Bus holds the safety of all its customers in very high regard and fully complies with the Safety and Health act 2006. Before departure, each bus undergoes rigorous testing and servicing at our fully equipped garage overseen by our highly qualified and trained technical team. In addition to that, each travelling bus has a qualified mechanic on board. This is done to make sure you travel in vehicle whose condition is unquestionable.
                                    In a bid to ensure your safety, we go an extra mile by equipping all our buses with fully stocked first aid kits and fire extinguishers in very good condition. Our staff is also given basic training on how to respond to emergency situations like fire outbreaks. Link Bus also empowers its customers by giving them security tips, travel tips as well as encouraging them to be vigilant.
                                    The most fascinating feature though, is the extremely vigilant security team. In order to ensure our collective safety, the team actively interacts with customers, monitors the terminals, thoroughly checks all buses and gates and looks out for any suspicious activity or luggage that is left unattended to. Additionally, all terminals and ongoing activity are monitored with the help of CCTV cameras at all times  </div>
